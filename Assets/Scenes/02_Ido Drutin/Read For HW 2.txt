Explanation in regards to the HW 2.

I added two reflection probes, one in the staircase and one in the lower room.
I have fiddled around with the lighting settings and changed some to mixed and used the adaptive probe volume in the upper room,
Ive added a grate light both in the upper and lower room and added adpative probe volume in the upper room, ive checked with the player prefab
it does work as intended.
Im still not 100% sure why im getting light bleeds in my textures ive tried baking many times with diffrent settings 
or doing the tricks you done in class but couldnt quite get the same result.
I do understand what reflection probes do, but i feel its a more powerful tool than i understand, it does help with the "Vibe" of the room,
But didnt understand if it has any bigger impact 
I have also added fog and some post processing :)
